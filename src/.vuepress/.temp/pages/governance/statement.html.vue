<template><div><p>Social, gossip, or gossip-type networks can be enhanced. An ideal network should aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>facilitate the sharing of content, thoughts, and analyses,</li>
<li>promote the immediate dissemination of information.</li>
<li>uphold the principles of ideal expression, respecting human rights and laws, and adhering to democratic principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the association is to establish such a network by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing the development of rules and specifications.</li>
<li>Coordinating the implementation of rules and specifications.</li>
<li>Ensuring continuous improvement of these processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The association conducts voting on rules and specifications and delivers open-source software based on these specifications.<br>
The open-source software constitutes a network.</p>
<p>All software should prioritize energy efficiency and environmental friendliness.</p>
<p>Additionally, the association strives to ensure the network is non-harmful and provides objective benefits to users, such as fostering better mutual understanding, facilitating rapid information dissemination and selection, and promoting collective intelligence.</p>
<p>The Decentralized Micro Blogging Association is an emerging organization that spontaneously emerges from individual actions and collective behaviors.</p>
