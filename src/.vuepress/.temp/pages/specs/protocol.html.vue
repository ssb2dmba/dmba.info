<p>Secure Scuttlebutt is a revolutionary protocol designed to create decentralized applications that operate efficiently without relying on continuous online connectivity or centralized control. By eliminating the need for a central server, Scuttlebutt enables clients to connect directly with their peers in order to exchange information. This comprehensive link below provides an in-depth exploration of the communication protocols employed within the Scuttlebutt network, shedding light on the intricacies of this groundbreaking technology.</p>

<li><RouterLink to="/specs/spip-02.html">spip-02 : message flow</RouterLink></li>
<li><RouterLink to="/specs/spip-03.html">spip-03 : decentralized identifier</RouterLink></li>
</ul>
<p>The SPIP process begins with a proposal from an individual or a group within the community. The proposal is then reviewed and discussed by other members, such as developers and users.</p>
<p>Simultaneously or subsequently, it can be implemented and coded. Then the proposal can be thoroughly examined. After a vote, the code is merged.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of the SPIP process is that it provides a structured and transparent approach to improving the SSB protocol. By allowing proposals to be reviewed and discussed by the community, SPIPs help ensure that protocol changes are well-approved and receive broad support.</p>
