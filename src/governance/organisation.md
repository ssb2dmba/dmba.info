Defining how the association help publishing features in next milestone, prioritize features and junk backlog is part of the challenge.

### features

- The association publishes what features are expected in next milestone.
- It proposes features into the backlog a stop on features required for a milestone. 
- Quality assurance enters the process at this point.
- Developers own the backlog and prepare a milestone

In-fine we get features required for milestone that represent an iteration, prioritized backlog and junk backlog.
