Social, gossip, or gossip-type networks can be enhanced. An ideal network should aim to:
- facilitate the sharing of content, thoughts, and analyses,
- promote the immediate dissemination of information.
- uphold the principles of ideal expression, respecting human rights and laws, and adhering to democratic principles.

The purpose of the association is to establish such a network by:

- Organizing the development of rules and specifications.
- Coordinating the implementation of rules and specifications.
- Ensuring continuous improvement of these processes.

The association conducts voting on rules and specifications and delivers open-source software based on these specifications.
The open-source software constitutes a network.

All software should prioritize energy efficiency and environmental friendliness.

Additionally, the association strives to ensure the network is non-harmful and provides objective benefits to users, such as fostering better mutual understanding, facilitating rapid information dissemination and selection, and promoting collective intelligence.

The Decentralized Micro Blogging Association is an emerging organization that spontaneously emerges from individual actions and collective behaviors.
