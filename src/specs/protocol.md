## Protocol

### SSB original protocol.

Secure Scuttlebutt is a revolutionary protocol designed to create decentralized applications that operate efficiently without relying on continuous online connectivity or centralized control. By eliminating the need for a central server, Scuttlebutt enables clients to connect directly with their peers in order to exchange information. This comprehensive link below provides an in-depth exploration of the communication protocols employed within the Scuttlebutt network, shedding light on the intricacies of this groundbreaking technology.

### SSB Protocol Improvement Proposal (SPIP)

- [spip-01 : invite-code flow](spip-01.md)
- [spip-02 : message flow](spip-02.md) 
- [spip-03 : decentralized identifier](spip-03.md)


The SPIP process begins with a proposal from an individual or a group within the community. The proposal is then reviewed and discussed by other members, such as developers and users.

Simultaneously or subsequently, it can be implemented and coded. Then the proposal can be thoroughly examined. After a vote, the code is merged.

One of the main advantages of the SPIP process is that it provides a structured and transparent approach to improving the SSB protocol. By allowing proposals to be reviewed and discussed by the community, SPIPs help ensure that protocol changes are well-approved and receive broad support.
